A JavaScript Library that makes even more easier to interact with [Commerce Layer API](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers) using the official [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-sdk).

## Installation and usage

```ts
import CommerceLayer from "@commercelayer/sdk"
import CommerceLayerUtils, { executeBatch } from '@commercelayer/sdk'

const cl = CommerceLayer({ organization, accessToken })
CommerceLayerUtils(cl)

await executeBatch(batch)
```

### Common functions

##### executeBatch

This function allows to prepare and then execute a number of API calls without having to worry about current rate limits.

```ts
for (const emailAddress of emailList) {
    const task: Task = {
      resourceType: "customers",
      operation: "create",
      resource: { email: emailAddress } as CustomerCreate,
      onSuccess: { callback: sendEmail },
      onFailure: { errorHandler: handleError }
    }
    tasks.push(task)
  }

  const batch: Batch = {
    tasks,
    options: { refreshToken: refreshAccessToken }
  }


await executeBatch(batch)
```

In the example above the `onSuccess` and `onFailure` callbacks have been used to handle the task result in case of success or failure of the execution.

It's also possible to fill the resource attributes taking values from the result of the previous batch step. In the following example we are updating a resource taking its id from a previous `retrieve` or `create` task:

```ts
const task: Task = {
    resourceType: "customers",
    operation: "update",
    prepareResource: (res: TaskResourceParam, last: TaskResourceResult): TaskResourceParam => {
        return {
          ...res,
          id: last.id,
          reference: 'new-reference'
        }
      }
  }
```

##### retrieveAll

This function allows to fetch all existing resources of a specific type executing all necessary API requests respecting current API rate limits.

```ts
const skus = await retrieveAll<Sku>('skus')
```

##### updateAll

This function allows to modify a set of resources of a specific type, using a filter to identify them.

```ts
const skuData = { reference_origin: 'legacy-system-0' }

const filters = { created_at_lt: '2023-01-01' }

const updateResult = await updateAll('skus', skuData, { filters })
```

---

### Cleanups

##### splitCleanup

Split cleanup in multiple cleanups respecting the maximum limit of resources included

```ts
const clp: CleanupCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 filters: { created_at_gt: '2020-01-01'}
}

const splitClp: CleanupCreate[] = await splitCleanup(clp)
```

##### executeCleanup

Split cleanup in multiple cleanups respecting the maximum limit of resources included and execute them

```ts
const clp: CleanupCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 filters: { created_at_gt: '2020-01-01'}
}

const execClp: CleanupResult[] = await executeCleanup(clp)
```

##### cleanupsToBatchTasks

Convert a list of cleanups generated by `splitCleanup` to a list of tasks that can be executed by the function `executeBatch`


```ts
const clps = await splitCleanup(clp)

const tasks = cleanupsToBatchTasks(clps)
```

---

### Exports

##### splitExport

Split an export in multiple exports respecting the maximum limit of resources included

```ts
const exp: ExportCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 filters: { created_at_gt: '2020-01-01'}
}

const splitExp: ExportCreate[] = await splitExport(exp)
```

##### executeExport

Split an export in multiple exports respecting the maximum limit of resources included and execute them

```ts
const exp: ExportCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 filters: { created_at_gt: '2020-01-01'}
}

const execExp: ExportResult[] = await executeExport(exp)
```

##### exportsToBatchTasks

Convert a list of exports generated by `splitExport` to a list of tasks that can be executed by the function `executeBatch`

```ts
const exps = await splitExport(exp)

const tasks = exportsToBatchTasks(exps)
```

---

### Imports

##### splitImport

Split an import in multiple imports respecting the maximum limit of inputs included

```ts
const exp: ImportCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 inputs: [
  { ... },
  { ... },
  ...
  { ... }
 ]
}

const splitImp: ImportCreate[] = await splitImport(imp)
```

##### executeImport

Split an import in multiple imports respecting the maximum limit of inputs included and execute them

```ts
const exp: ImportCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 inputs: [
  { ... },
  { ... },
  ...
  { ... }
 ]
}

const execImp: ImportResult[] = await executeImport(imp)
```

##### importsToBatchTasks

Convert a list of imports generated by `splitImport` to a list of tasks that can be executed by the function `executeBatch`


```ts
const imps = await splitImport(imp)

const tasks = importsToBatchTasks(imps)
```

---


### Webhooks

##### denormalizePayload

This function takes in input the payload of a webhook in JSON format and transform it in the appropriate typed resource to be used with the official Typescript SDK.

```ts
const shipment = denormalizePayload<Shipment>(webhookPayload)
```

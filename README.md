A JavaScript Library that makes even more easier to interact with [Commerce Layer API](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers) using the official [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-sdk).

## Installation and usage

```js
import CommerceLayer from "@commercelayer/sdk"
import CommerceLayerUtils, { executeBatch } from '@commercelayer/sdk'

const cl = CommerceLayer({ organization, accessToken })
CommerceLayerUtils(cl)

await executeBatch(batch)
```

### Common functions

##### executeBatch

This function allows to prepare and then execute a number of API calls without having to worry about current rate limits.

```js
for (const emailAddress of emailList) {
    const task: Task = {
      resourceType: "customers",
      operation: "create",
      resource: { email: emailAddress } as CustomerCreate,
      onSuccess: { callback: sendEmail },
      onFailure: { errorHandler: handleError }
    }
    tasks.push(task)
  }

  const batch: Batch = {
    tasks,
    options: { refreshToken: refreshAccessToken }
  }


await executeBatch(batch)
```

##### retrieveAll

This function allows to fetch all existing resources of a specific type executing all necessary API requests respecting current API rate limits.

```js
const skus = await retrieveAll<Sku>('skus')
```

##### updateAll

This function allows to modify a set of resources of a specific type, using a filter to identify them.

```js
const skuData = { reference_origin: 'legacy-system-0' }

const filters = { created_at_lt: '2023-01-01' }

const updateResult = await updateAll('skus', skuData, { filters })
```

---

### Cleanups

##### prepareCleanups

Split cleanup in multiple cleanups respecting the maximum limit of resources included

```js
const clp: CleanupCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 filters: { created_at_gt: '2020-01-01'}
}

const prepClp = await prepareCleanups(clp)
```

##### cleanupsToBatchTasks

Convert a list of cleanups generated by `prepareCleanups` to a list of tasks that can be executed by the function `executeBatch`


```js
const prepClp = await prepareCleanups(clp)

const tasks = cleanupsToBatchTasks(prepClp)
```

---

### Exports

##### prepareExports

Split an export in multiple exports respecting the maximum limit of resources included

```js
const exp: ExportCreate = {
 resource_type: 'customers',
 filters: { created_at_gt: '2020-01-01'}
}

const prepExp = await prepareExports(exp)
```

##### exportsToBatchTasks

Convert a list of exports generated by `prepareExports` to a list of tasks that can be executed by the function `executeBatch`


```js
const prepExp = await prepareExports(exp)

const tasks = exportsToBatchTasks(prepExp)
```

---


### Webhooks

##### denormalizePayload

This function takes in input the payload of a webhook in JSON format and transform it in the appropriate typed resource to be used with the official Typescript SDK.

```js
const shipment = denormalizePayload<Shipment>(webhookPayload)
```
